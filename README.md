# CelesteTAS
My Celeste TASes that I have created.

You'll probably want to look inside the Finished folder if you want to improve anything I made.

Most of my TASes are sub-optimal, because I'm still relatively new to TASing.
## Finished Folder
those are the ones that I have completed. I will be looking to improve on them, but they reach the end of the level.

## Unfinished Folder
Those are the ones that I have abandoned (most likely because I forgot about them)
